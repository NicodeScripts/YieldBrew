# â˜• YieldBrew

YieldBrew is a simple AI-powered tool designed to estimate coffee yield (in kg/ha) based on environmental and agricultural conditions. It was built as a lightweight proof-of-concept for a hackathon focused on sustainable and tech-enabled coffee farming.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

YieldBrew uses a regression-based neural network trained on synthetic agricultural data to predict coffee yield from various input features like rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, soil pH, and more.

The model is wrapped in a simple interactive Gradio interface for easy demonstration and experimentation.
